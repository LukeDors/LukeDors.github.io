    <h1>League of Legends Data Analysis Overview</h1>
    <p>For this project I have begun gathering game data for all champions in League of Legends on their most decicated and highest ranked players (OTPs).
        As a result, I will have the most recent games from various sites (lolalytics.com, u.gg, op.gg) from the top 50 OTPs from each major region (EUW, KR, NA), 
        and I may include LAS as well. Currently, I have collected data from Galio OTPs to get a general sense of the data I will be working with. I am using MongoDB
        for this, as I want the ease of working with specific collections, although I will have to later restructure much of this into standard tabular dataframes later 
        in the project.
        Each snapshot is structured like the code below:
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        My goals for this data are:
    </h4>
    <p>• Display what top OTPs build for various matchups</p>
    <p>• Identify any differences between champs in other regions</p>
    <p>• Discover which champions are the most feast/famine</p>
    <p>• Find the best bans based on top players for each champion</p>
    <p>• Highlight the biggest differences between OTP winrates and non-OTP winrates (skill floor/ceiling)</p>
    <p>• Show which champions scale the best comparatively</p>
    <p>• Find ideal champion pools given a single champion</p>
    <p>• Create a machine learning model which predicts game outcomes at team preview</p>
    <p>As This is an example of each game. This will likely fluctuate in terms of structure after I transition to using the Riot API, but that only allows me 
      to get the most recent 20 games from each player. With scraping, I can collect far more than just 20 games.
    </p>

      This is an example for each datapoint I will be working with for now:

      This is a multi-part project, the first of which can be found <a href="p1/index.html">here</a> (incomplete). Eventually, I will create 
      an entire site which visualizes each element of this project in a user-friendly manner, but for now it will be a step-by-step process.
