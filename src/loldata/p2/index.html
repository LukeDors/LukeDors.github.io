    <h4>
        Data Cleaning
    </h4>
    <p>
        For this section, I converted the bulk of my Mongo database into a Pandas dataframe for aggragation and ease of use. I 
        removed duplicate rows and then separated the dataframe into smaller dataframes where the only data is of a single champion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This data will be skewed somewhat because I did not separate by role. Obviously lanes will differ in various different ways, but 
        this is more a test for now to see what the data looks like. In addition, some champions will be missing as they did not have OTP 
        data at the time of collection. This will be later updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ran the following code which helped me identify which variables I should focus on, create the table I will use for the graph, 
        and create the graph itself:

  <h4>
    Analysis:
  </h4>
  <p>
    This graph is more expressive than I thought it would be, given that I do not have as much data as I would like.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Things visible to indicate this is a valid way if interpreting the data:
  </h4>
  <br>
  <p>• A lot of champs that depend on innate traits for viability or heavy CC dont require a lot of gold or a huge lead (Annie, Maokai, Sion).</p>
  <p>• Champs like Shen/Warwick will never have a lead for the most part, since they have no waveclear and depend on roaming/CC for usefulness.</p>
  <p>• Heavy snowballing junglers are at the top for both areas, alongside ADCs. These are the best champions for easily winning games when ahead, so this makes sense.</p>
  <p>• Toplaners, notably bruisers who are famous for having the least impact are at the bottom for both spectrums, so that checks out.</p>
  <p>• Supports dont require much of a lane lead, but do require gold which I find odd. A huge number of supports are in the same area though, so I am inclined 
    to feel that it is an accurate trend though.
  </p>
  <p>• Shaco apparently requires no gold at all! Likely an outlier which will change with more data, but a funny observation nonetheless.</p>

  <h4>Aggrssive vs Passive, Damaging vs Supporting</h4>
  <br>
  <p>I normalized each of the below variables, added them together, normalized the sum, and then 
    scaled the valued between -1 and 1.
  </p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/LukeDors/ff1edd969bb3c249b33ff2088e53285b.js"></script>
  <p>Aggressive vs Passive: multikillsAfterAggressiveFlash, pickKillWithAlly, quickSoloKills, timeCCingOthers, soloKills, damageTakenOnTeamPercentage</p>
  <p>Damaging vs Supporting/Utility: teamDamagePercentage, multikills, damageDealtToBuildings, totalDamageDealtToChampions, kills</p>
  <div class="graph">
    <img src="corr2.png"></img>
  </div>
  <p>I feel most of these variables make sense, but I added building damage because otherwise splitpushers would be so 
    low in terms of damage when they really are providing decent damage. An alternative graph without that variable can be found <a href="corr3.png">here</a>
