    <h4>
        Data Cleaning
    </h4>
    <p>
        For this section, I converted the bulk of my Mongo database into a Pandas dataframe for aggragation and ease of use. I 
        removed duplicate rows and then separated the dataframe into smaller dataframes where the only data is of a single champion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This data will be skewed somewhat because I did not separate by role. Obviously lanes will differ in various different ways, but 
        this is more a test for now to see what the data looks like. In addition, some champions will be missing as they did not have OTP 
        data at the time of collection. This will be later updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ran the following code which helped me identify which variables I should focus on, create the table I will use for the graph, 
        and create the graph itself:

  <h4>
    Analysis:
  </h4>
  <p>
    These are the sorts of findings I was hoping to have, as there is a fairly even distribution between many of these items. I was worried 
    that the end result would be ~60% Everfrost, which I am aware is the main mythic item on Galio, but there seems to be a wider variety 
    of playstyles than I previously thought. Obviously the next three items being boots makes perfect sense, as midlane requires a lot of 
    different skillshots to dodge, but seeing the occasional Night Harvester or Liandry's Anguish is exciting. It means I can go and 
    visualize what players do into different matchups, and it will not always be Everfrost into Merc Treads. Some players are playing 
    tank Galio with the Abyssal Mask into Frozen Heart, which is not usually two items one would commonly associate with Galio, so I am 
    interested to see what some of the matchup data looks like.
