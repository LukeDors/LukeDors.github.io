        Galio Itemization
    </h4>
    <p>
        To begin, I took the data I collected on Korean Galio OTPs and wrote a script which finds each of the first items purchased 
        in each final build. This only includes items which are in the final build at the end of the game, so there is always the possibility 
        of some inconsistencies with the data via selling items. Note this does not include Potions, Wards/Trinkets, Tier 1 Boots, 
        or Dark Seal, but DOES include Bramble Vest and Oblivion Orb as those are important to rush in some matchups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I only collected games where galio played in midlane. There are some Galio support OTPs and likely some games toplane, 
        but in order to maximize the data and prevent a small number of datapoints in other roles, I kept it to midlane for now.

  <h4>
    Analysis:
  </h4>
  <p>
    These are the sorts of findings I was hoping to have, as there is a fairly even distribution between many of these items. I was worried 
    that the end result would be ~60% Everfrost, which I am aware is the main mythic item on Galio, but there seems to be a wider variety 
    of playstyles than I previously thought. Obviously the next three items being boots makes perfect sense, as midlane requires a lot of 
    different skillshots to dodge, but seeing the occasional Night Harvester or Liandry's Anguish is exciting. It means I can go and 
    visualize what players do into different matchups, and it will not always be Everfrost into Merc Treads. Some players are playing 
    tank Galio with the Abyssal Mask into Frozen Heart, which is not usually two items one would commonly associate with Galio, so I am 
    interested to see what some of the matchup data looks like.
