Threats & Synergies
Vayne
Extreme
Play around her E cooldown. Only all in with sums. 
Quinn
Extreme
Play around her E. Farm up and ping her missing, she can roam pretty well and snowball off your team.
Jayce
Major
If the Jayce is good this matchup should be unplayable for Darius.
The key to too all in him the moment he swaps to Ranged Form. He has no Tools to deal with Darius for a while after swapping to his Ranged form.
Riven
Major
Cancle 3rd Q and don't fight her with ult up. Kite her Q and make her use all her spells for movement and not for dmg.
Jax
Major
Poke with Q and hook him before/while he uses the E. Can be run down after his E is down.
Cassiopeia
Major
Dodge her Q's and play around her W cooldown since she can deny u the ultimate.
Sett
Major
Play around his W cooldown OR hook him right before using ulti so he can not shield the damage.
Fiora
Major
Don't ever hook into her W. She hard outscales, so u need to get ahead early-mid.
Teemo
Major
Without sums he is easy to run down even with his blind up. Just don't get poked too hard to all in. Run past him when u are blinded, since u can not attack him anyway.
Akali
Major
Avoid getting poked by her Q. She loses out on alot of energy if she does not hit. Play around her W cooldown and respect her E dmg since it has the most dmg in her kit.
Yorick
Major
Darius wins early. Do not fight in the cage. And play around the E. 
Gwen
Even
Play around her W cooldown and don't all in into her ultimate.
Wukong
Even
Ignite Wukong level 6+ can 100-0 even into boneplate. But with his ult down he becomes killable. Use your passive to see if he uses his W.
Irelia
Even
Respect her Stacks and dodge the E. Hardly depends on how skilled the Irelia is. Hook before Q to guarantee a hit.
Dr. Mundo
Even
Boring to play against and almost impossible to kill in lane. Easy target to stack and does not have CC to stop Darius in skirmishes. Farming lane.
Aatrox
Even
Dodge his Q's! Play around the Q cooldown it is pretty long early. With his ult up Aatrox is hard to kite and gets a masssive stat boost.
Kennen
Even
He can NOT kill you 100-0 because his dmg is pretty low. Easy to run him down when he has no E. Rush Mercs and go Armor in runes for early lane.
Akshan
Even
If you have to, give up cs early to not die pre 6 since he is way stronger early. Steelcaps rush. With ult and and ghost up he can not do anything.
Yone
Even
Try to avoid fighting him while he has his E active. If he uses his 3rd Q into u run him down.
Gangplank
Even
Can be annoying to deal with. Play around the E recharge/cooldown. Don't get poked too much.
Nasus
Minor
Zone him from CS early. If he gets some too much stacks he is unbeatable 1v1. Without his wither he can be killed 1v1 early/mid game.
Volibear
Minor
Do NOT fight inside his E or with his shield up.
Camille
Minor
All in her after she uses E or cancel it with hook and don't get poked by her W. Avoid taking short trades to a point where she can win the all in before u hit 5 stacks.
Tahm Kench
Minor
The goal should not be to kill him, since he is a weak champ out of lane. Don't dive him or fight close to his tower and he can't play the lane.
Shen
Minor
Don't let him trade and dash out. Run him down after his dash and just run behind him when he uses his W.
Lillia
Minor
Do not underestimate her early power. Fight her with ghost up to not get kited by her insane movementspeed.
Garen
Tiny
Don't throw all spells into his W. Don't short trade him or tank his entire E. 
Cho'Gath
Tiny
Dodge the Q and u are good to go.

Champion Build Guide
Items
MYTHIC
TRINITY FORCE
✦  Trinity Force
synergizes with Darius kit very well. Weaker waveclear then STRIDEBREAKER. Best Mythic for 1v1 in sidelane and to decimate tower.
DIVINE SUNDERER
✦  Divine Sunderer
offers alot of sustain and good dmg against tanky champions. The buildpath is decent. Into tanky champions that rush  Heartsteel (like  Dr. Mundo) this Mythic is really strong. Good alternative Mythic to build in hard matchups.
STRIDEBREAKER
✦  Stridebreaker
this item makes it really hard to kite Darius. Once completed it is nearly impossible to escape Darius. Against a full ranged comp this item is a must buy. Very good item to push sidelane and quickly join skirmishes (shove and move).
2ND ITEM
Death's Dance
good armor item that offers good survivability against burst. Really strong item to take over a game.
Dead Man's Plate 
the 40ms passive makes this item really strong on champs like Darius. Even tho it is expensive for it's stats it is worth it. Helps with the weakness of  Darius getting kited.
Black Cleaver
strong stats and offers movementspeed even from  Hemorrhage. Downside is that there is no shield and the armor pen is not really needed since  Apprehend's Passive is enough for most games plus  Noxian Guillotine deals true damage.
Only worth it if the enemy has atleast 300+ Armor or your entire team is AD and lacks the dmg to kill the enemy.
3RD ITEM
Force of Nature 
good movementspeed item with HP and MR, buy this if enemy has a big AP Carry or 2-3 AP heavy champs.
Maw of Malmortius 
good item against AP burst. Also offers alot of dmg. Combined with  Death's Dance Darius R can deal 1000 dmg before lv16.
Sterak's Gage
allows Darius to skirmish much safer and offers good damage. Darius  Hemorrhage keeps you in combat what gives a bigger shield. Good option if the enemy has burst AD damage. Since it scales wtih Base AD it works great with  Trinity Force.
Hullbreaker
same stats as  Sterak's Gage and offers good sidelane power. Downside is that there is no shield and the armor/magic resist are gone in teamfights. After the nerfs only good for splitpush.
OTHER ITEMS
Guardian Angel
good against a fed assassin/burst mage or champs with champs that heavly rely on their ultimates(Noc/Wukong/VI etc.). Also Darius  Hemorrhage stacks last longer than Guardian Angel revive animation, so you don't lose your stacks immediately. Must buy if u are the wincon.
Anathema's Chains
this item offers an insane amount of HP and you can bind the biggest threat. Also the HP scales insanely well with  Sterak's Gage and  Gargoyle Stoneplate.
Gargoyle Stoneplate
offers good amount of survivability for Darius, but the buildpath is pretty bad. Lategame item choice.
OR
Anti Heal Items depend on the game. There is no clear best item, but very often darius does NOT need antiheal.
Chempunk Chainsword
Mortal Reminder
Thornmail
OR
Either of those items are good items if you get killed by ADC or Autoattack heavy champs.  Randuin's Omen vs crit based champs obviously.
Frozen Heart
Randuin's Omen
All other Tank Items are great for Darius, since late game his role is more that of a tank than a bruiser.
TL;DR
Trinity Force/ Stridebreaker first into  Dead Man's Plate then  Death's Dance/ Maw of Malmortius and then tanky items. Works in most of the games if u don't want to think about items.

★ TIPS & TRICKS
LANE
Darius job in Lane is to punish the enemy for using long cooldown spells. You want to setup a freeze and zone the enemy by threatening an all in. Don't short trade too much with the enemy or you won't have enough HP to get your passive in an all-in before you die. Also try to avoid using your spells inside your freeze or it will break.
In the first 4 waves try to crash the 2nd or 3rd depending on matchup and let it bounce back into you and run the enemy down when the wave is close to your tower.
LV1
There are only a few champs that Darius can not beat with starting W Lv1. Against Meele try to get lv2 first and all in if possible. Against ranged farm as much as possible, but do NOT trade HP for minions. The enemy jungler can dive you and you will fall behind very hard. Especially if you get dove on the 3rd wave.
If you can get firstblood lv1 against a TP user - reset! Do NOT stay and fight again.
LV2-LV3
My goal is to crash wave 3 and get a deep ward. This does not work certain champs that are stronger than Darius lv1-3 or if you need to reset because of the Lv1/Lv2 all in. Crashing the 3rd waves also gives prio for top scuttle aswell, so unless it is not possible trying to crash the 3rd wave is good on Darius.
!BUT League is very chaotic do not try cookie cutter Macro every single game!
LV6+
After hitting Lv6 you want to look for all in windows after the enemy used a crutial cooldown. If the jungle Matchups allows it you can also go for 2v1's.
MID GAME
Look to fight for objectives with your sums up. Try to avoid skirmishes without your Summoner Spells and time your sums with neutral objective timers. Lv11 is a big Powerspike to play around, aswell as the 2 item powerspike.
TEAMFIGHT
Get your  Noxian Might from a tank or low mobility champion before diving into the enemy team. Do NOT flash in 3+ enemy champions expecting to get the passive before they kill you. Playing it slow is almost always the best play.
RESSOURCES
Take as many ressources as possible. Enemy jungle should be your jungle. Deny as much ressources as possible by crashing waves in the tower and if possible zone the enemy away from the tower.
GROUP VS SPLIT
Depending on the amount of enemy engage options you need to group more against a Leona/Malph/Naut then you need against a Ziggs/Tryn/Soraka.
LATE GAME
Darius Late game is more of a tank than a damage dealer. So you have to protect your team and look for good  Flash  Apprehend combos to pick someone or just play for a good reset with  Noxian Guillotine.
TEAMFIGHT
At this point in game you just want to peel for your strongest carry. Stand next to them and deny the enemy a chance to kill them. Your best bet is to get a 5 Stacks  Noxian Guillotine on the enemy carry.
TIPS & TRICKS 
Darius  Noxian Guillotine is a leap what enables him to jump over small walls. This works against Yorick  Dark Procession, Anivia's  Crystallize and Jarvan'  Cataclysm. Snares or getting grounded on the other hand disables the ability to ult. So avoid spells like Cassiopia's  Miasma.
